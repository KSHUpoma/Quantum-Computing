        "* Their first bit should definitely agree since there was never any superposition involved. However, their second bit could have been different without them realizing it due to Eve's interception since the qubit was in a superposition. This potential difference is exactly what Alice and Bob are hoping to exploit to catch Eve intercepting.\n",

        "* Related to the answer above, the first bit should have been the same for all three of them. However, as soon as Alice uses an H gate, she leaves Eve with a 50/50 chance of getting the same value as Alice. From there, if Bob applies an H gate he has a 50/50 chance of getting the same value as Eve. In this situation, there's no telling whether Eve and/or Bob have the same bit as Alice. Furthermore, if they don't compare bits then none of them will know if their keys are the same or not! This is one way to see just how disruptive BB84 makes Eve's presence.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The first bit they compare (attempted bit 3) was not in superposition, so Eve could not have caused any noticeable effect with her measurement and therefore she should not have been caught.
