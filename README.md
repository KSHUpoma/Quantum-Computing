# Quantum-Computing
# Whatâ€™s the Double-Slit Experiment?
Imagine youâ€™re playing with tiny balls (like particles: electrons or light bits). You throw them at a wall with two tiny doors (slits). Behind the wall is a screen that glows when a ball hits it. Letâ€™s see what happens!
# Step 1: Throw Balls (Like a Particle)
 What you expect:
If you throw balls at the two doors, they should go through one door or the other and make two piles on the screen.
ðŸŽ¯â†’ ðŸšªðŸšª â†’ ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¦ (two blobs).
This is how normal stuff works!
# Step 2: BUTâ€¦ Magic Happens! (Wave-Particle Duality)
 When you actually do this with tiny particles (like electrons or light):

 What happens: Instead of two piles, you see stripes (like a barcode)!
ðŸŽ¯â†’ ðŸšªðŸšª â†’ ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ (stripes!).
This is called an interference pattern!

# Why?
The particles act like WAVES (like water waves). They go through BOTH doors at once, wiggle around, and crash into each other to make stripes. Magic! âœ¨ðŸŒŠ
